This Flask application accepts a user login input through a form and converts the entered username into uppercase before processing. The username is then passed as a query parameter in the URL, retrieved on the server side, and displayed on the browser in UPPER CASE. The application also checks whether the submitted input is already in uppercase and displays an appropriate message to inform the user. This project demonstrates basic form handling, query parameters, string manipulation, and conditional logic using Flask.
